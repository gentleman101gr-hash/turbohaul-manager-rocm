    """Raised when a slot's completion_future is failed due

    DEDICATED Exception subclass — NOT a reuse of asyncio.CancelledError —
    because:
    - CancelledError inherits from BaseException (Py 3.8+), which slips past
      ``except Exception:`` handlers and ``raise from None`` chains. Routes
      catching ``Exception`` would silently drop CancelledError-shaped
      eviction signals.
    - Semantic clarity: 'we evicted because the client disconnected' is a
      different fault domain from 'event loop cancelled this task'. Mixing
      them costs us metric / 4xx-vs-5xx clarity.

    Routes catch this in their non-streaming await chain and surface HTTP 499
    (client_closed_request).

    Full-prompt keying: hash the FULL normalized prompt rather than
    only a leading word-prefix. Logically-distinct requests that share a long
    common preamble -- e.g. parallel sub-agents with an identical delegation /
    system prompt but different tasks -- previously collided to ONE ``auto-``
    thread_id (only the first 64 words were hashed) and were serialized as a
    single conversation by the ACTIVE_MATCH / grace path. Keying on the full
    prompt gives them DISTINCT thread_ids so the fan-out runs them concurrently.

    Trade-off: naive same-prefix multi-turn no longer reuses the warm slot via
    thread_id. Acceptable because (a) the model warm-hold is the model-keyed
    IdleHotTimer, NOT thread-keyed, and (b) the sidecar prefix cache
    (cache_reuse / slot_prompt_similarity) is independent of thread_id -- so
    follow-ups still get fast prefill. Hermes (a supported client) manages its own
    context and sends full prompts per request, so it never relied on the
    thread-prefix reuse anyway.

    ``prefix_tokens`` is retained for call-site compatibility and ignored.
    Normalization is word-based (whitespace split) so incidental whitespace
    differences still map a semantically-identical prompt to one thread_id.
