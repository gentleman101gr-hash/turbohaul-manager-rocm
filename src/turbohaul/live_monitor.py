"""Live inference monitor — ground-truth tok/s + progress + live output text.

Gives turbohaul its OWN view of what the active sidecar is decoding, independent
of any client CLI. Two cleanly separated data planes:

  1. ROBUST CORE (stream-mode independent): ``LiveSlotsPoller`` polls the active
     llama-server's ``GET /slots`` ~1Hz, derives tok/s + progress from
     ``next_token[0].n_decoded`` deltas, and writes a redacted ``generation``
     block into ``mgr.live_generation`` that ``status_snapshot()`` exposes. It is
     a PURE OBSERVER: it copies (pid, port, spawn_seq) scalars off the manager in
     one synchronous read, RE-VALIDATES handle identity after the httpx await
     (fixed-port 11500 reuse race), never holds a Slot, never blocks/locks the
     worker_loop, never mutates FSM state, never iterates ``_inflight``.

  2. THIN LIVE-TEXT TEE: ``LiveOutputBuffer`` holds per-generation bounded ring
     buffers fed by the streaming tee in ``api/chat_completion.py`` and read ONLY
     by the dedicated SSE endpoint in ``api/live_stream.py`` — token TEXT never
     rides the EventBus, so the /ws/state redaction denylist stays intact.

Both planes key on ONE unified ``generation_id`` = blake2b(pid:spawn_seq:thread).
